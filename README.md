# Inequality in Education
As a part of my internship program at IBM in collaboration with CSRBOX, I undertook a project titled, Inequality in Education.
* This project delves into the critical issue of unequal 
access to quality education across the globe, aligning with the United Nations' 
Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduce Inequality within and among countries.
* We used data from 
various sources, including Kaggle and the Human Development Reports, to explore factors contributing to educational inequality such as socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, and geographic location.
* The project involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling and visualization to uncover patterns and trends in educational outcomes.
